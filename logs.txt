PhisnomGD: Hey, Galactic.
RealMatiass: galactic wanna play something else later
EvanLikesGames: Like For A Level You Think Is Good Practice For You (:
bigchungfunni: geometry slop levels real?
Galactic71: Hi Fornyax, Iceboi, Phisnom, Crystal
Saltinnee: like i do a few jumps in a row on an extreme and im like "oh this is an entry extreme" and its not
HercyPlay: Uff, more 4 att is gg!
Littlegirl78: @real wdym who am I?
FornyaxGD: hi galactic
crystalizeed: I once made a extreme demon layout but never uploaded it cuz i thought it was unbalanced asf
fursona: yeah i might not be able to beat my extreme, but i know part A has a similar difficulty to B, C, & D
sukkus: nooo en el 90
Galactic71: My pfp is a gurl (/j)
RealMatiass: Hi Galactic       :3
KingCornball: oh thats lucky you have an easy out if you wanna kill yourself then
RealMatiass: i have a slight suspect who littlegirl is but yeah
PhisnomGD: Meep
azertite055: what's the canonical path
Littlegirl78: ok im deleting my pfp for u guys :)
Saltinnee: i always overestimate how hard extreme demons are honestly and that sets me back a lot
Galactic71: Hi
michaelautism: i would die if its popped
azertite055: or does the stuff you make just scale itself as you get better at playing
KingCornball: michael you should try popping it a little harder
Littlegirl78: @king no ur not me fattie
michaelautism: because some people hate you littlegirl.
azertite055: is it the more common path for people to make harder gameplay from below
fursona: @fornyax its more about knowing the difficulty relative to the other parts and even other jumps
RealMatiass: "11 year old girl" like bro
Littlegirl78: why are people asking me to delete my profile post
KingCornball: Im littlegirl78
michaelautism: i mean it is with a unpoppable cyst
Saltinnee: @fursona i guess people love your level lmao
RealMatiass: who is this littlegirl bait acc like bro who would fall for that only jcstalls
azertite055: because when i made the gameplay for that one extreme i am pretty sure i was coming into if from above? like i was making straight up impossible befor
KingCornball: your brain is getting messed with
FornyaxGD: @fursona how do you make gameplay when you cant even beat it?
Wkgoated: Phisnom sorry for late reply it's no biggie tho I get to focus on other stuff now
michaelautism: id rather have my autism & adhd over getting my brain messed with
KingCornball: Or just kill yourself thats always an option
fursona: @crystal its mainly about knowing how to playtest and to balance
Saltinnee: anyone can make an extreme but its very hard to make a good extreme
michaelautism: oh god no
alafajna8: robslope
eefilipytGD: cool level :)
Littlegirl78: michael idk!!
KingCornball: you should get a lobotomy I think that might help with both your autism and adhd
michaelautism: how littlegirl
Littlegirl78: my bathroom dissappeared
kostyak56: neploxo 3/3
monster1987: the nonexistent clubstep monster got me
azertite055: you know now that i think about it. why did i start to make super extreme or even impossible levels in the first place
DemiuxGaming: gg 3 att
michaelautism: just... out of pure craziness & lack of dopamine
Saltinnee: @fursona GDDL geometry dash demon ladder
Wiexs: Rob you okay? why this daily?
michaelautism: for example, if i dont take my meds, i might as well as bash my head against the keyboard
tesodre: god 
crystalizeed: @Fursona you kinda have to see some extremes first, or else youll make a russian 9yo kids SLH slop
KingCornball: Id hate the autism more
fursona: @saltine which demon list?
michaelautism: however... the disability i have that i hate is ADHD
Saltinnee: @jass imagine how funny it would be if the new top 1 pemon is just a classice gd level like that
fursona: @crystal you dont have to play extremes to know how to make one
KingCornball: well thats one upside to being a tard I guess
iloveanimals123: robslope
azertite055: it's accomplishable with some item presistence and a teleport at the beginning but still official support would make it more widespread
Tealgalaxy: bruh no one even wants try my riddle bruh
Saltinnee: @fursona it has like a 9.8/10 on the gddl last i checked lmao
PhisnomGD: Bad Grammar: *Exists* Me:
Jassachusetts: salt that can be made by using a force block that follows you in platformer mode
NaomiBloxx: this feels like a 3 stars in some parts
michaelautism: it does
crystalizeed: But at the same time- I havent beaten any extremes yet so idk how to really make a good one
fursona: @crystal somehow my extreme demon is fun to play, according to the people who beat it
Saltinnee: @crystal acu sucks so much. its fun in noclip yeah but actually playing it is so bad
Tealgalaxy: @saltinne bruh then why do we have practice mode?
HercyPlay: 1 att but i'm lose!
wolfmaster72: what
Saltinnee: robtop should unironically add checkpoints to classic mode
forcelini9: nice level :D
KingCornball: michael so the autism in this case plays in your favor
crystalizeed: Yk what, i should try make a extreme demon thats like acu. Aka fun to play
Izxxn666: 1 att!
money0401: first try, nice.
michaelautism: i probably would've hit less
tonjirodude992: bro cooked
fursona: Meanwhile people tell me i should make a list demon, which like ew no
Tealgalaxy: @fornyax wtfh no!
KingCornball: michael you think maybe if you werent autistic you couldve hit already
azertite055: if i would make an extreme i would upload it unverified and wait for someone to beat it because i omega suck at this game
Jassachusetts: Chatting on mobile rn my shit is splattered on the walls and its grotesque and has hair on it am i cooked
FatymCz: i like nock em style
FornyaxGD: @teal verbalase exposed
player56734: i hate the coins
crystalizeed: @Salt real
michaelautism: it did, but her parents are overprotective, so i cant date with her until 2 years later
PhisnomGD: @Wk Ohh.. I'm sorry that happened.
crystalizeed: If i tried to make an extreme demon it would 100% get insane demon because i suck and nerfed it
Saltinnee: god i hate how many ideas i have for levels i work on for one day and then delete :(
Tealgalaxy: i literally gave a big hint
ImParti: gg daily level, gg normal level
KingCornball: oh boy It didnt work out huh michael

KingCornball: michael so youre in classes that are appropriate for your age
Tealgalaxy: i dont think ill sleep again
Chpenky: 1/2 only probl3m with miror portals is that mostly they are used in part where u need to do 
Bironilla: yeah if you ply the gauntlets it actually steals your mums bank acc infi
michaelautism: i am sure, because ive never been in a special class
Littlegirl78: @jassa what!!!
fursona: @saltine if you do make an extreme, please playtest it
Jassachusetts: biron yes
Tealgalaxy: now im never gonna sleep bc of what i just saw
FabianGul1: gg 1att
Yummygarathon: @starcarr Just Chilling, tbh.
KingCornball: are you sure because sometimes they wont tell you
Saltinnee: and only for like ~8 seconds before switching back
RealMatiass: who remembers uh         lemonbox
Jassachusetts: gauntlets are dungeons where you get dookied and erped
starcarr: I feel like if Rob used the mirror portal more, people would have less problems with it
michaelautism: i graduated sped, & i do not take sped class
Bironilla: jassa is this a common thing
Saltinnee: wait i DID use a mirror portal recently. and by recently i mean like 6 months ago in a layout lol
KingCornball: michael so I assume you get placed in special classes
DeadMadSkull: gg 1 att
Tealgalaxy: now im even more traumitized o0_0o (galaxies have 4 eyes btw)
Littlegirl78: what are gauntlets supposed to do
fursona: my favorite meme i did in my extreme was making a fake triple spike

starcarr: Yummy Fine, HRU :3c | Fursona Nobody mirrors the portal :(
geometryisme864: i am technologically advanced
KingCornball: michael "over a month" doesnt really give anyone a good idea
Jassachusetts: Yo where are these full white cat icons with under 1k stars coming from 
crystalizeed: Mirror portals are good people just never learned how to get used to them.

ChairGirl: exactly

gunster212: its very easy
michaelautism: yeah
BaconNoobYt: Hippoking this was easy 
starcarr: Fursona Wow, ppl are babies sometimes, willing to do 3 more clicks to avoid mirror SMH
fursona: but people always avoid the mirror portal by doing 3 very fast inputs (this is intentional)
KingCornball: michael so youre 16
hippoking321: gg 1 att
gunster212: ummmmmm
geometryisme864: im gonna stock on diamomds

Yummygarathon: @pheonix i think i may have a slight idea on what you mean
Bironilla: wdym "sausage"
fursona: @starcar i a section where you can remove 3 inputs from the level, but the rest would be mirrored
KingCornball: Ive been chatting since I was 7 and Id say it was very necessary
NikolaosKC: Simple and fun.
BaconNoobYt: Cocmcsdacsadkmnsadkjsandjsahdjusahdjksahdjksadhjsak
michaelautism: oh
Pheonix070: i found a "sausage" on my pinapple pizza.
